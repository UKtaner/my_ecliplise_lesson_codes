 Primitives are not classes even wrapper types, so there is no child-parent relation in between them. 
 There is no inheritance relation in between among data types such as primitives or wrappers etc.

 @ every classes uses object class and the constructor comes from the object class
 @ if no extends than no child.
 @ if there is no parents class than we can not create child class.
 @ if there is no parent class than we can not use any variables in child class.
 @ this()==> to call a constructor in a class itself. example: in dog class, we have constructor1,constructor2,constructor3, 
 so to call from 1 to 2. contructor we use this().  
 @ To go to parent class from child, we will use super().Parent constructor caller.
 @ if the names are same java uses the parent name not grans parent name
 @override shows method is coming from parent
 ant its modifier should be wider or same.
